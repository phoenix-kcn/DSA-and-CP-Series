# DSA and CP Series

## In this repo you can find useful practise problems.

### Problem 1
Find out how to find if a number is power of 2 or not witout any loop.
> **Hints:**
* You must use Bitwise Operator to solve this problem.

### Problem 2: The Integer Reversal Challenge

**Objective:**
Design an algorithm that accepts an integer and returns it with its digits reversed.

**Examples:**
* Input: `456` → Output: `654`
* Input: `753951` → Output: `159357`

### Strategy & Hints
* **Keep it fundamental:** You do not need to convert the number into a string or use fancy libraries.

### The Mathematical Logic

At first glance, reversing a number like **25** to get **52** feels intuitive. However, to teach a computer to do this, we must deconstruct the **Base-10** place value system.

Think of the number **25**:
`25 = (2 * 10) + (5 * 1)`

To reverse it to **52**, we are essentially swapping the importance (weight) of the digits:
`52 = (5 * 10) + (2 * 1)`

### Problem 3: Reverse an array of integers

**Objective:**
Write a programme that reverses an array of n number of integers.

**Examples:**
* Input: `[1, 2, 3, 5]` → Output: `[5, 3, 2, 1]`
* Input: `[76, 0, -5, 164, 16, 8]` → Output: `[8, 16, 164, -5, 0, 76]`

### Hints
* Use a loop and then swap the first and last elemant of they reversed totally.
